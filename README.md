# dotfiles
My dotfiles configuration, for having a fresh development machine.

# Situation

I Have started to work with WSL2 with windows 10. I have realised that It will be nice to have my common tooling in my daily setup and It will be nice to have all of this setup portable (with this I can setup a development machine in minutes).

# What contains

Here you find a basic interactive installation script.
It will install:

- Zsh and OhmyZsh (With my plugin setup)
- netcore 3.1
- exa (a supercharged ls replacement)
- nvm (Node version Manager)


# How to install
 Just clone or download this repo and execute ```install.sh```

 Happy Hacking ðŸ˜Ž
